\begin{problema}
	A top consists of a disc of radius \(R\) and a straight light pole
	that constitutes the axis of the top. This axis passes through the
	fixed point \(O\). The distance between \(O\) and the disc is \(L\).
	The angle \(\alpha\) between the axis and the vertical remains fixed.
	The plane that passes through the axis of the top and the vertical through
	\(O\) rotates with constant angular velocity \(\Omega\) about the vertical
	through \(O\). Determine the angular velocity \(\omega\) of the top
	relative to this plane.
