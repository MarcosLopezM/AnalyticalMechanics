\begin{problema}
	Calculate the moments of inertia of:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A uniform circular cone of mass \(M\), height \(h\) and base
		      radius \(R\) with respect to the principal axes whose origin
		      is at the vertex of the cone.
		\item A solid uniform cylinder of radius \(r\), height \(2h\) and
		      mass \(M\) about its centre of mass. For what height-to-radius ratio
		      does the cylinder spin like a sphere??
	\end{enumerate}
