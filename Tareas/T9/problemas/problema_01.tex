\begin{problema}
	A particle \(A\) of mass \qty{3}{\m} is suspended from a fixed point \( O\) by a spring
	of strength \(\alpha\), and a second particle \(B\) of mass \qty{2}{\m} is suspended
	from \(A\) by a second identical spring (see Figure). The system performs small
	oscillations in the vertical straight line through \(O\). Find the normal
	frequencies, the forms of the normal modes, and a set of normal coordinates.
