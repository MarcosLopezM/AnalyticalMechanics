\begin{problema}
	A uniform rod of length \(2a\) is suspended from a fixed point \(O\) by a light
	inextensible string of length \(b\) attached to one of its ends. The system
	move in a vertical plane through \(O\). Take as coordinates the angles \(\theta\)
	and \(\phi\) between the string and the rod respectively and the downward vertical.
	Show that the equations governing small oscillations of the system about
	\(\theta = \phi = 0\) are

	\begin{equation*}
		b \ddot{\theta} + a \ddot{\phi} = -g\theta,
	\end{equation*}

	and

	\begin{equation*}
		b \ddot{\theta} + \dfrac{4}{2}a \ddot{\phi} = -g\phi.
	\end{equation*}

	For the special case in which \(b = 4a/5\), find the normal frequencies and the
	forms of the normal modes.
