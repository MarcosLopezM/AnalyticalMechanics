\begin{problema}
	Write down the Lagrangian for the projectile (subject to no air resistance),
	in terms of its Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\), with \(z\) measure
	vertically upward. Find the three Euler-Lagrange equations and show that
	they are exactly what you would expect for the equations of motion.
