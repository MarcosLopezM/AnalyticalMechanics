\begin{problema}
	A particle in a uniform gravitational field is constrained to the surface
	of a sphere, centered at the origin, with a radius \(r(t)\) which is a
	given function of time. Obtain the Hamiltonian and the canonical equations.
	Discuss energy conservation. Is the Hamiltonian the total energy?
