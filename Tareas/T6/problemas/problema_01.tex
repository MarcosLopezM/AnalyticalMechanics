\begin{problema}
	It has been previously noted that the total time derivative of a function
	of \(q_{i}\) and \(t\) can be added to the Lagrangian without changing the
	equations of motion (tarea 4). What does such an addition do to the canonical
	momenta and the Hamiltonian? Show that the equations of motion in terms of
	the new Hamiltonian reduce to the original Hamilton's equations of motion.
