\begin{problema}
	Consider a platform that is rotating about the \(z\)-axis with
	constant angular velocity \(\omega = \omega \uvec{k}\) in the
	inertial reference frame \(\mathcal{O}\). Let \(\mathcal{O}^{\prime}\)
	denote a reference frame that is rotating with the platform.
	An object of mass \(m\) is connected to a string that is pulled
	radially inward along the surface of the platform a t a
	constant speed \(v\) in \( \mathcal{O}^{\prime}\). At the instant
	shown in \zcref{fig:problem04}, the object is at a distance \(r = r^{\prime}\)
	from the center of the platform. What is the velocity of
	the object \(v\) in the reference frame \(\mathcal{O}\)?
