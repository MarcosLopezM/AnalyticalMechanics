\begin{problema}
	A particle of mass \(m\) is confined to move, without friction, in
	a vertical plane, with axes \(x\) horizontal and \(y\) vertically
	up. The plane is forced to rotate with constant angular velocity \(\Omega\)
	about the \(y\) axis. Find the equations of motion for \(x\) and \(y\),
	solve them, and describe the possible motions.
