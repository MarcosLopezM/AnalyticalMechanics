\begin{problema}
	A particle moves in one dimension, in a potential \(V(x)\), where \(x\)
	is the spatial coordinate. The dynamics is governed by the Lagrangian

	\begin{equation*}
		L = \dfrac{1}{2}m^{2}\dot{x}^{4} + m \dot{x}^{2}V(x) - V(x)^{2}.
	\end{equation*}

	Show that the resulting equation of motion is identical to that which
	arises from the more traditional Lagrangian, \(L = \tfrac{1}{2}m \dot{x}^{2} - V(x)\).
\end{problema}
