\begin{problema}
	Use the Lagrange multiplier method to solve the following problem: A
	particle in a uniform gravitational field is free to move without
	friction on a paraboloid of revolution whose symmetry axis is vertical
	(opening upward). Obtain the force of constraint. Prove that for a
	given energy and angular momentum about the symmetry axis there are
	a minimum and maximum height to which the particle will go.
